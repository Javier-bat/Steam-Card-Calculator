# steam_card_calculator
Steam card calculator for farming , now it is made for Argentina Pesos(You have to change the Pesos value in the code for accuracy), i am lazy to get some api for more regions.
You can change the code to work for more regions.

To run install python3 and pip install the required libraries.

The code have UI AND CLI, the cli is better.

The code shows normal cards count,name and prices, the total value of normal cards for an steam game from the APPID and if there are profitable.
Pretty bad approach and code but it's working.
